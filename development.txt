2018-02-05 22:53; Initial commit of development log. Worked 4 hours at FLNV today. Bricked scapula servo. RIP. Probably by using ax18 control table. Installed Moveit Prerequisites from http://moveit.ros.org/install/source/ in catkin_ws. Movit seems to be good for creating twist topics, setting goal poses and joint goals. It does the whole motion planning aswell. Using dxlTosser on openCM9.04, I successfully connected a dynamixel to single_manager. By updating XL_320.device in kinetic/shara/dynamixel_workbench_toolbox, I was able to also control it to a big degree. Some specific features might be missing, such as PID, could not guess their key binding. Tried to recover bricked dynamixel using roboplus on windows, but it could not find the device. RIP. However, it works even better than dynamixel_workbench single manager, all features for xl-320 works. Even PID. Should keep I under 50, because here it oscillates. Small P is funny though, since it kindof acts as an overshoot and feather thing. Must still wait for the next workbench release for proper XL-320 support. I don't know why all the code for workbench is not found on github. device files e.g. I should follow dynamixel workbench controller tutorials next, to actually use python to interact with my dynamixels.
